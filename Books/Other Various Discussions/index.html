<h2>Code Reads: Big Ball of Mud</h2>
<font size="4">In this article, Rosenberg addresses Brian Foote and Joseph Yoder’s 1999 paper “Big Ball of Mud.” The ball of mud is similar to that of spaghetti code mentioned in Dreaming in Code chapter 9, a big jumble of code. These big balls of mud, or messy programs, are not necessarily wrong. In fact, they tend to work most of the time. The issue with big balls of mud is they are hard to update and maintain. <br>

    The article suggests that big balls of mud, which can be ugly, unorganized, and uninteresting, can be beneficial at times and should not necessarily be tossed aside as garbage code. </font>

<h2>DevOps</h2>
<font size="4">The priorities of developers and operators are often different, leading to conflict and little communication between the groups. DevOps aims to destroy this. DevOps allows for better integration between developers and operators (DevOps, get it?). This integration is possible through the automation of things like workflow, infrastructure, and application performance.<br>

      This method not only speeds up development processes, it also improves the quality of applications.</font>

<h2>The Inevitable Pain of Software Development</h2>
<font size="4">The article, “The Inevitable Pain of Software Development,” addresses the issue of programming accidents within the world of programming. Programmers all have certain steps or tasks that they dread having to accomplish. Because of this, the often postpone and procrastinate these steps which leads to “the inevitable pain.” Research has found that there is no real escape from these steps. When one finds a new method of dealing with a situation, it is inevitable that a new “pain” will arise to take the place of the one that had been extinguished. <br>

In the end, one must “bite the bullet” and get the job done instead of trying to find easier ways around the problem.</font>
