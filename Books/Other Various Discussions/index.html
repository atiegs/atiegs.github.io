    <h2>Code Reads: Big Ball of Mud</h2>
    In this article, Rosenberg addresses Brian Foote and Joseph Yoder’s 1999 paper “Big Ball of Mud.” The ball of mud is similar to that of spaghetti code mentioned in Dreaming in Code chapter 9, a big jumble of code. These big balls of mud, or messy programs, are not necessarily wrong. In fact, they tend to work most of the time. The issue with big balls of mud is they are hard to update and maintain. <br>

      The priorities of developers and operators are often different, leading to conflict and little communication between the groups. DevOps aims to destroy this. DevOps allows for better integration between developers and operators (DevOps, get it?). This integration is possible through the automation of things like workflow, infrastructure, and application performance.<br>
