        <li><strong>What roles in the Chandler project did Michael Toy, John Anderson, Ted Burgess, Mitchell Kapor, and Lou Montulli hold?</strong></li>
        •	Michael Toy is the project manager <br>
        •	John Anderson is the systems architect and lead coder <br>
        •	Ted Burgess is a younger programmer <br>
        •	Mitchel Kapor is the founder of OSAF<br>
        •	Lou Montulli is a programmer <br>
            <p></p>
        <li><strong>What is “Bugzilla?”</strong></li>
            Bugzilla is a bug tracking system used to identify defects during programming. 
            <p></p>
        <li><strong>What is OSAF?</strong></li>
            The Open Source Applications Foundation.
            <p></p>
         <li><strong>What is the project's name?</strong></li>
            The Chandler Project.
            <p></p>
        <li><strong>What will the software do?</strong></li>
            It is a personal information managing software.
            <p></p>
         <li><strong>What is Toy’s keyword for “black hole” bugs?</strong></li>
            “A developer’s nightmare.”
            <p></p>
        <li><strong>What scared Toy so much about Bug 44?</strong></li>
            Bug 44 was contained in wxWidgets, a software the team was using to develop Chandler. In order to fix the issue, they had to either wait for a fix by the coders of wxWidgets or find a workaround themselves.
            <p></p>
        <li><strong>What did Toy refer to as a “snake?”</strong></li>
            “Snakes” are “important problems that we don’t have consensus on how to attack.” 
            <p></p>
        <li><strong>In the software world, what does “slippage” mean?</strong></li>
            It is another word for "lateness."
            <p></p>
        <li><strong>Fredrick Brooks was a programming manager for what software project?</strong></li>
            International Business Machines (IBM)
            <p></p>
        <li><strong>What is Brook's Law?</strong></li>
            “Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.”
            <p></p>
        <li><strong>Brooks found what % of project time was spent writing code?</strong></li>
            He found that 16.67% (or 1/6) of time should be used writing code.
            <p></p>
        <li><strong>Brooks found what % of project time was for testing and fixing bugs?</strong></li>
            50% of time should be spent testing the program and fixing bugs.
            <p></p>
        <li><strong>Brooks observed that the unit of effort named “man-month” only applied under what conditions?</strong></li>
            Only when the required task could be “partitioned among many workers with no communication among them.”
            <p></p>
        <li><strong>What is the difference between source code and the program you install (.exe) on your computer?</strong></li>
            Source code is the original code written by the programmer(s), it is readable and understandable. An .exe file has been converted into binary and therefore unreadable to humans, only machines. 
            <p></p>
        <li><strong>What is the one “article of faith” that all “open source” or “free” software advocates share?</strong></li>
            "Software anyone can tinker with is bound to improve over time in ways that ‘closed’ software can’t match.”
            <p></p>
        <li><strong>What is the difference between a “good” programmer and a “great” programmer?</strong></li>
            Good programmers can write code and great ones can rewrite and reuse it.
            <p></p>
        <li><strong>Eric Raymond’s book “The Cathedral and the Bazaar” made a distinction between two important project development ideas, briefly contrast them.</strong></li>
        •	The first method is to build software carefully and quietly until it is time to be released (i.e. a video game designed for a gaming system like the Xbox of PlayStation). <br>
        •	The second method is to release early and provide updates as you go (i.e. a smartphone app or a PC video game). <br>
            <p></p>
        <li><strong>Has “open source” software project development refuted Brooks’ “Mythical Man-Month” concerns?</strong></li>
            Open source software revealed a substitute to Brooks’ Law. Open source makes time less important because the work is done by volunteers and therefore more fun and ego driven as opposed to a more corporate approach. 
            <p></p>
        <li><strong>What was Andy Hertzfeld’s input when the Chandler project appeared to have stalled?</strong></li>
            His input was to stop designing and begin coding. The sooner they could get exciting work going, the better.
