              <li><strong>What is the three-way trade-off that many software projects struggle to overcome.</strong></li>
              The “three-way trade-off,” sometimes called the “quality” or “impossible” triangle, is a method commonly used while coders develop programs. The system features three choices: fast, cheap, and good. Typically, only two of these three choices could be selected to effectively produce a product. However, in reality it is not uncommon for these choices to vary from time to time during production.

              <li><strong>What is the more recent definition of “geek?”</strong></li>
              The term “geek” started off as an insult referring to asocial, glasses-wearing, pasty-faced individuals. Eventually, the term transformed and is now defined as “one who pursues technical skill and imagination rather than mainstream social acceptance”.

              <li><strong>What does “refactoring” mean to programmers?</strong></li>
              Refactoring is the process of rewriting code to create simpler, clearer, and easier to read. It is a difficult practice that is seemingly endless.

              <li><strong>What is “yak-shaving?”</strong></li>
              “Yak-Shaving” is the act of preparing for an act. For instance, a coder may need a certain program to run his software but the program he needs requires a special kind of code but then… and the list goes on. Yak shaving will often lead programmers down rabbit holes and they will lose track of what they were trying to accomplish in the first place.
