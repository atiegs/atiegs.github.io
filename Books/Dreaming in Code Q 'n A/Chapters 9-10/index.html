      <h1>Chapters 9-10</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
      <p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Structured programming evolved to address what programming practice?</strong></li>
            Structured programming addressed one-way code transfer such as GOTO statements. These would often get mixed up creating what was known as “spaghetti code.”
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>Was structured programming a solution to the problem of software development?</strong></li>
            It benefited in a very minimal way, the problem of software development is still a difficult one.
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>Have any techniques shown to improve the software development process?</strong></li>
            Watts Humphrey, the “ultimate” project management disciplinarian, used his “Must. Plan. More!” technique to create successful schedule discipline. 
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>The “waterfall model” of programming was/is popular. What were some problems with this model?</strong></li>
            The waterfall model was a programming method in which various tasks would be completed in a cascade. This led to several issues including delays and broken programs. 
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>What are the four tenets of Agile Software Development?</strong></li>
            i.	Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. <br>
            ii.	Working software over comprehensive documentation. <br>
            iii.	Customer collaboration over contract negotiation. <br>
            iv.	Responding to change over following a plan. 
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>What did a 2004 study find about the development practices of some two hundred software team leaders?</strong></li>
            They discovered, much to their dismay, that there was no dominant practice whatsoever.
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>What is the “Joel Test” and what did he say about Microsoft and the Joel Test.</strong></li>
            The Joel test asks 12 questions regarding developmental organization. Any score below 10 is evidence of “serious problems.”
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>What is Rosenberg’s Law?</strong></li>
            Making software is easy until one is required to make it do something new. However, the only software worth making is one that does something new.
            <p></p>

    <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
        <ol>  
            <li><strong>Chapter 10 is about the notion of “Software Engineering” and the difficulty of applying this label to the development of software. The author suggests that Yertle the Turtle provides an important lesson for programmers. Describe it.</strong></li>
