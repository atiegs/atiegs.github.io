      <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Keep track of team members: 2001 --> Mitch Kapor, Morgen Sagen, Al Cho, Andy Hertzfeld</strong></li>
            In 2001 they began meeting to decide on what software they were to create. 
            <p></p>
        <li><strong>When introducing a new technology or design, why did Frederick Brooks advise “plan to throw one away?”</strong></li>
            He advised this since it is very uncommon to get things right on the first attempt.
             <p></p>
        <li><strong>2002, Katie Parlante joined Chandler. When she first joined what did she do?</strong></li>
            When Parlante joined, she discovered ways PIM could make meetings and phone calls easier. 
            <p></p>
        <li><strong>John Anderson joined Chandler as “systems architect.” Briefly, what did that mean?</strong></li>
            Anderson decided on the look of menus and dialogue boxes, the programming language that would be used, and the types of storage to be implemented. 
            <p></p>
         <li><strong>What is a “core” dump? Why the use of the word core?</strong></li>
            A computer’s active memory is its “core.”  A core dump occurs when a major error inhibits the system and the computer displays an error file that describes what went wrong. 
            <p></p>
        <li><strong>How did Erik Sink, speaking of abstractions, describe what programmers do?</strong></li>
            Sink describes programming as building large amounts of abstractions which are then layered on top someone else’s abstractions. 
            <p></p>
        <li><strong>Rather than writing program statements in binary code, 110101110 1001101111, programmers developed a shorthand language called what?</strong></li>
            Fortran (Formula Translating System) was the first widely accepted method of shorthand programming language. 
            <p></p>
        <li><strong>Adding layers of abstraction, new programming languages were created: Lisp, Cobol, Algol, Basic. Fortran was the first widely used. What kind of program converted Fortran to binary?</strong></li>
            An “uberprogram” called a compiler translates Fortran to binary.
            <p></p>
        <li><strong>What are the implications behind: “...there is no Moore’s Law for software. Chips may double in capacity every year or two; our brains don’t.”?</strong></li>
            It is saying to not overuse one’s time when it comes to optimizing code to fit the smallest possible amount storage. Let the computer do the hard work. 
            <p></p>
        <li><strong>The language selected for Chandler was Python. What does it mean that Python was an interpreted language?</strong></li>
            The source code being created is converted to binary while it is being written, as opposed to before the program is run. This has positives in that it is more dexterous and negatives in that is a slower process. 
            <p></p>
        <li><strong>The announcement of Chandler occurred when?</strong></li>
            It was announced on October 20th, 2002 by the Mercury News.
