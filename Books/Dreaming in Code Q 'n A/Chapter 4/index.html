             <li><strong>What do “front ends” and “back ends” mean to software developers?</strong></li>
             The front end of a program is the one the user deals with, such as menus, dialogues, etc. The back end is where all the inputs and are pushed and dealt with. 
             <p></p>
             <li><strong>What did the Lego Hypothesis refer to?</strong></li>
             It is the idea that, eventually, all programs will be prebuilt and reusable. Like putting together a Lego set, building software would be putting prebuilt programs together to create a finished product.   
             <p></p>
             <li><strong>Give one reason the Lego Hypothesis seems to not work so well.</strong></li>
             One reason the hypothesis may not work well is variety. Different programs require different kinds of functions. When it comes to programming, nothing is a constant. Very rarely do two pieces of code fit into two different programs, there are just too many varying factors.
