        <li><strong>Define Byte.</strong></li>
        A byte is another term for 8 bits of data. 
        <p></p>
        <li><strong>What is the range of an unsigned byte? A signed two's complement byte?</strong></li>
        Unsigned bytes contain positive integers ranging from 0-255 (256 in total). A two’s complement bytes show negative integers ranging from -128-127.
        <p></p>
        <li><strong>What does the X in the following binary number represent 1010X10101?</strong></li>
        X could represent 2^6 or 64.
        <p></p>
        <li><strong>What is the base 16 number system called?</strong></li>
        The base 16 number system is referred to as the hexadecimal system. 
        <p></p>
        <li><strong>Why is base 16 a good choice for representing binary numbers?</strong></li>
        Base 16 works because it is a power of 2 (as well as 4). This allows for an even division of bits.         <p></p>
        <li><strong>What base 16 number is 101011000011? What is an easy way to determine this without using a calculator?</strong></li>
        16 is a power of four so 101011000011 can be broken down into groups of 4. 1010, 1100, and 0011. By observing the chart in this chapter, one can find the following conversions: 1010=A, 1100=C, 0011=3. Therefore the hexadecimal value is AC3. 
        <p></p>
        <li><strong>What does the X represent in the following base 16 number D4AXF0?</strong></li>
        X could represent 16^2 or 256.
        <p></p>
        <li><strong>The book describes how to convert decimal to base 2 or base 16. Research and describe a technique that allows conversion of decimal to any base (2-36).</strong></li>
        Here is a method I found of converting a decimal to any base:
        <br>
        N ÷ B = D, R -> D = N, R = M
        <br>
        N is the decimal number. <br>
        B is the base number.<br>
        D is the result. <br>
        R is the remainder. <br>
        M is the completed conversion number.<br>
        The process <strong>repeats</strong> itself until the decimal is equal to 0.<br>
        
        As an example, the process to convert the decimal 7 to binary would look like this: <br>
        7 ÷ 2 = 3, 1 -> 3=3      1=1  ->   1 <br>
        3 ÷ 2 = 1, 1 -> 3=3       1=1 ->  11 <br>
        1 ÷ 2 = 0, 1 -> 0=0       1=1 -> 111 <br>
    </ol> </font>

     <h2>Chapter 16</h2>
     <ol> <font size="4">
        <li><strong>What do the prefix names kilo, mega, giga, tera, and peta represent in bytes and what were the Greek origins of the words?</strong></li>
        A kilobyte is 1024 bytes. In Greek, <i>kilo</i> comes from the term <i>khilioi</i> which means 1000. However, since binary is based on the power of 2, a kilobyte cannot equal 1000 and therefore must equal the closest base 2 number: 1024. <br>
        <i>Mega</i> comes from the Greek term <i>megas</i> which means "great". A megabyte is 1,048,576 bytes. <br>
        <i>Giga</i> comes from the Greek <i>gigas</i>, meaning giant. A gigabyte is 1024 megabytes. <br>
        <i>Tera</i> comes from the Greek <i>teras</i>, meaning monster. A terabyte is 1,099,511,627,776 bytes. <br> 
        <i>Peta</i> comes from Greek meaning 5, denoting the 5th power in base 1000 and the 15th in base 10. A petabyte is 1,125,899,906,842,624 bytes which is approximately a quadrillion. 
        <p></p>
        <li><strong>At the end of Chapter 16 the author reminds the reader about something that is "very important," what is this?</strong></li>
        This very important thing is regarding memory. RAM (random-access memory), sometimes referred to as volatile memory, will disappear without a power source. This means that everything in a RAM chip will be erased if there is no power.
