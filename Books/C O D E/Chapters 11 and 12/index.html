 <p>
     <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
     <ol>
         <li><strong>Briefly describe the four gates explained in Chapter 11. Describe the behavior of each gate based on the input values to the gate.</strong></li>
         i.	    <strong>AND gate.</strong> The AND gate typically use two inputs and a single output. For an output to be administered, both input switches must be closed. <br>
         ii.    <strong>OR Gate.</strong> Like the AND gate in that it produces an output when both switches are closed, but an OR gate will also produce an output when either of the switches are closed. <br>
         iii.	<strong>NOR gate.</strong> The NOR gate is the opposite of an OR gate. This means that if 1 or both switches are closed there will be no output. If both switches are open, there will be an output. <br>
         iv.	<strong>NAND gate.</strong> The NAND gate is the opposite of the AND gate. In this way, when both switches are closed there will be no output. <br>
     </ol>

     <ol>
         <li><strong>A half adder is built from how many "sub components" and has how many inputs and outputs?</strong></li>
         A half adder is built from an AND gate and an XOR gate. It features two inputs and two outputs.
         <p></p>
         <li><strong>A full adder is built from how many "sub components" and has how many inputs and outputs?</strong></li>
         A full adder is built from two half adders and one OR gate. It also has two outputs, 1 sum and 1 carry. 
         <p></p>
         <li><strong>How many total inputs and outputs are there for an 8-bit adding circuit?</strong></li>
            16 inputs for an 8-bit adder. 
         <p></p>
         <li><strong>How many total transistors are needed for the ripple version of the 8-bit adder?</strong></li>
            144 transistors total. 
        </ol>
