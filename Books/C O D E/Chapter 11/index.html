      <h1>CODE Chapter 11</h1>
 <p>
     <ol>
         <li><strong>Briefly describe the four gates explained in Chapter 11. Describe the behavior of each gate based on the input values to the gate.</strong></li>
         i.	    <strong>AND gate.</strong> The AND gate typically use two inputs and a single output. For an output to be administered, both input switches must be closed. <br>
         ii.    <strong>OR Gate.</strong> Like the AND gate in that it produces an output when both switches are closed, but an OR gate will also produce an output when either of the switches are closed. <br>
         iii.	<strong>NOR gate.</strong> The NOR gate is the opposite of an OR gate. This means that if 1 or both switches are closed there will be no output. If both switches are open, there will be an output. <br>
         iv.	<strong>NAND gate.</strong> The NAND gate is the opposite of the AND gate. In this way, when both switches are closed there will be no output. <br>
     </ol>
