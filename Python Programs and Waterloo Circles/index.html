    <h2>Hangman Game</h2>
    <p> The code below is a simplified version that will <strong>not</strong> run, the downloadable link, however, <strong>will</strong> run. <br>
        I could not figure out how to get python to open the 10000 word list so I just added all 10000 words using the .split('') function. <br>
        So, to make things seem more clean (and not have there be 10000 words to scroll through), I just simplified it here. The download contains all 10000 words.
